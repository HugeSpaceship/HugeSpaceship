# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently as HugeSpaceship is in very early development, no guarantee of security is provided, and the software is provided AS IS.

When it stabilises to the point of being usable this will change, and when the server is more mature there will be properly supported versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability either use the report tool in GitHub or send me a message in discord (my username is `zaprit`).

Please don't make an issue as this leaves other users vulnerable to attack.
