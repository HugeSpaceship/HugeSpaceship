An experimental LittleBigPlanet server focused on customizability and performance

## Status
Currently, the game server is in a mostly functional state for level uploads, etc. Matchmaking is unimplemented and so is Recent Activity

The website is currently under development, and this will require a decent API.

Authentication is currently a free-for-all as there's no rate limiting or whitelisting or api auth besides NPTickets and session tokens
